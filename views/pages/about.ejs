				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>On October 21, 2019, Jeffrey, then a Blair sophmore, started working on Blairpath as an open project for the Blair Magnet program's Algorithms and Data Structures B (ADSB) course. The branding was created as a parody of <a href="https://blairbash.org">Blairbash</a>, and the website was initially developed and hosted on <a href="https://replit.com">Replit</a>.</p>

				<p>On April 8, 2021, Blairpath started being hosted at its own domain, blairpath.org, through <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a>.</li>

				<h3>Contributing</h3>
				<p>Being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_Blair_High_School">the most populous school in the state of Maryland</a>, mapping out the entire campus is a large task. Contributions of any kind, including new maps, measurements, labels, or categorizations, as well as contributions to the source code, are welcome.</p>
				<p>Blairpath is <a href="https://github.com/jwt4517/blairpath">open-source on GitHub</a>.</p>
				<p>To learn how to make cartographic contributions through the website's editing system, read the <a href="/tutorial">tutorial</a>.</p>
