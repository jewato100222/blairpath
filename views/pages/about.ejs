				<h1>About</h1>

				<h3>History</h3>
				<p>Blairpath was started on October 21, 2019 by Jeffrey Tong, then a Blair sophomore, as an open project for the Magnet program's Algorithms and Data Structures B (ADSB) course. Initially created with <a href="https://replit.com">Replit</a>, it drew inspiration from <a href="https://blairbash.org">Blairbash</a>.</p>
				<p>He finished the Alpha version (v0.12.2) on December 16, 2019 and the first Release version (v1.0.0) on January 20, 2020.</p>
				<p>A long development hiatus began after the first semester of the 2019â€“2020 school year.</p>
				<p>He restarted substantive work in February 2021 as a junior for the Future of Programming (FoP) course's open project.</p>
				<p>On March 28, 2021 (for v1.4.0), he released Blairpath to GitHub, thereby making it an open-source project.</p>
				<p>On April 8, 2021 (for v1.5.0), he began hosting Blairpath at its own domain, <a href="/">blairpath.org</a>, through <a href="https://heroku.com">Heroku</a> and <a href="https://domains.google/">Google Domains</a>. The site's original location, <a href="https://blairpath.jeffreytong.repl.co/">blairpath.jeffreytong.repl.co</a>, will remain available but henceforth hold a notice redirecting visitors to the new domain.</p>
