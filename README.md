# Blairpath

[Blairpath](blairpath.org) is a website that provides mapping tools to help students, teachers, and visitors of Montgomery Blair High School navigate and survey the school campus.

The application is hosted remotely using [Heroku](heroku.com) as a cloud server and [Google Domains](https://domains.google/) as a DNS provider service.

If you would like to contribute map data, follow the directions on the website's tutorial instead.

If you would like to suggest posssible improvements for the software, you can open a pull request. Make sure that when you make updates, you increase the version number in both `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.
