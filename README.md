Blairpath (formerly hosted at http://www.blairpath.org) is a website that provides mapping tools to help students, teachers, and visitors of Montgomery Blair High School navigate and survey the school campus.

The website is not currently being hosted on its own domain, but we plan to host it again soon. You can use the [archived Replit](https://81d8ecfd-ca27-4963-948c-4ce42ba7f41e-00-22virfovc06v7.worf.replit.dev/map/) for now.

If you would like to contribute map data or suggest posssible improvements for the software, feel free to open a pull request.
